# KudoSphere - Kudos App Frontend

**KudoSphere** is a recognition platform where team members can appreciate each other’s efforts by giving **Kudos**. This is the frontend application built using modern web technologies and integrates seamlessly with the Django backend via secured REST APIs using JWT authentication.

---

## Tech Stack

- React.js (via Vite)
- Redux Toolkit + RTK Query
- React Router DOM
- Material UI (MUI)
- JWT for authentication
- ESLint (for code quality)

---

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v18 or later)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- A code editor (e.g., VS Code)
- Backend API running (refer to backend [README](https://github.com/iamvishalaggarwal/kudos_backend/blob/master/README.md))

---

## Installation

```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash

```

### 3. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add (if unavailable):

## 🔐 Authentication

- The login endpoint (`/api/auth/login/`) is publicly accessible.
- All other routes require a **JWT token**.
- Tokens are stored in `localStorage` and injected automatically using **RTK Query**.
